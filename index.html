                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h3>Fourth-Year Project</h3>
                <h3>Locale-specific deep learning colourisation applied to NLI/NFC/NUI Galway Archives resources</h3>
                <p>The focus of this project was to re-train a popular automatic black and white photograph colourisation model to be more accurate on Irish photographs.
                    This was to be achieved by balancing generic training data sets, e.g. OpenImages, with Irish ones, e.g. National Library of Ireland.</p>

                <ul class="skill-names">
                    <li>Teamwork</li>
                    <p>Developed strong interpersonal and teamwork skills, through membership of the Energy society, the literary and Debating Society and engineering teams.</p>
                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                    <p>Well-developed problem-solving skills. An example of this is when, in my fourth-year project, the resulting images were not accurate colours. I solved this problem by identifying that the training data was not diverse enough to train the model sufficiently well, so I re-trained with a better dataset.</p>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                    <p>Effective communicating skills. Developed through participation in debates in the Literary and Debating society as well as through being a class representative.</p>
                    <li>Computing</li>
                    <p>Strong programming skills, preferred languages are Java, Python, VBA, SQL, and web development. Examples of these can be seen on my GitHub page, which is linked.</p>
